Major Category: Individual
Freelancer / Professional & Sole Proprietor / Business Owner
These two subcategories have similar tax obligations. The main taxes are on income and sales, with a choice in how to file.

Income Tax:

Option 1: Graduated Income Tax Rates (0% to 35%)

Tax is based on net taxable income (gross sales/receipts less business expenses).

Filing is done quarterly and annually.

Quarterly Filing (BIR Form 1701Q):

1st Quarter: Due on or before May 15

2nd Quarter: Due on or before August 15

3rd Quarter: Due on or before November 15

Annual Filing (BIR Form 1701): Due on or before April 15 of the following year.

Option 2: 8% Flat Income Tax

Available for those with annual gross sales/receipts of not more than ₱3 million and who are not VAT-registered.

Tax is on gross sales/receipts in excess of ₱250,000.

This option is in lieu of both percentage tax and the graduated income tax.

Filing follows the same quarterly and annual schedule as the graduated rates.

Business Tax (for those not on the 8% flat tax option):

Percentage Tax (BIR Form 2551Q):

A 3% tax on gross sales or receipts.

Applicable if annual gross sales/receipts do not exceed ₱3 million and you're not VAT-registered.

Quarterly Filing: Due on or before the 25th day of the month following the end of each quarter.

Value-Added Tax (VAT) (BIR Form 2550Q):

A 12% tax on the gross selling price of goods or gross receipts for services.

Required if annual gross sales/receipts exceed ₱3 million.

Quarterly Filing: Due on or before the 25th day of the month following the end of each quarter.

Withholding Taxes:

Expanded Withholding Tax (EWT) (BIR Form 0619E): Withheld from a company's payments to you for professional services. Your client remits this to the BIR. You can use the Certificate of Creditable Tax Withheld at Source (BIR Form 2307) as a tax credit when you file your own income tax.

Monthly Filing: Due on or before the 10th of the following month.

BMBE (Barangay Micro Business)
Barangay Micro Business Enterprises (BMBEs) are small businesses with assets of not more than ₱3 million. They are granted significant tax exemptions to encourage growth.

Income Tax: BMBEs are exempt from income tax on income derived from their operations. Therefore, they are not required to file quarterly or annual income tax returns.

Other Taxes: While exempt from income tax, BMBEs are still subject to other taxes like:

Percentage Tax: Applicable if not VAT-registered.

Withholding Taxes: BMBEs are not automatically exempt from withholding tax obligations as payors.

Local Business Taxes: BMBEs are also exempt from local business taxes, but this can vary depending on the local government unit's ordinances.

Mixed-Income Earner
A mixed-income earner receives income from both an employer (compensation income) and from a business or profession (business/professional income).

Income Tax:

Your compensation income is subject to Withholding Tax on Compensation by your employer, who will remit it to the BIR. They will provide you with a BIR Form 2316 at the end of the year.

Your business/professional income is subject to the same tax rules as a freelancer or sole proprietor (either the graduated rates or the 8% flat tax option).

Annual Filing (BIR Form 1701): You must consolidate both types of income and file one single annual income tax return. You will use your BIR Form 2316 as proof of the taxes withheld from your compensation.

Other Taxes: You will have separate business tax obligations (percentage tax or VAT) for your business income, following the same schedule as a sole proprietor.

Estate / Donor Case (One-time)
These are one-time tax obligations triggered by a specific event.

Estate Tax (BIR Form 1801):

A tax on the right of the deceased person to transmit their estate to their legal heirs.

The tax rate is a flat 6% on the value of the net estate.

Filing Schedule: The return must be filed and the tax paid within one (1) year from the date of the decedent's death. The BIR may grant an extension for a valid reason.

Donor's Tax (BIR Form 1800):

The tax rate is a flat 6% on the net gifts in excess of a ₱250,000 exemption.

Filing Schedule: The return must be filed and the tax paid within thirty (30) days after the date the gift is made.

Corporate Income Tax (CIT) (BIR Form 1702Q/1702):

Other Taxes: This includes Documentary Stamp Tax (DST) on various transactions and Local Business Tax (LBT), which is a local tax paid annually to the city or municipality.

Foreign Corporation (Branch/ROHQ)
Foreign corporations are taxed only on income derived from sources within the Philippines.

Branch Office: Treated similarly to a domestic corporation, subject to the same tax rates and schedules for CIT, VAT, and withholding taxes on its Philippine-sourced income.

Regional Operating Headquarters (ROHQ): These are taxed on their income from services rendered in the Philippines. They are subject to a 10% final tax on their taxable income.

Regional Headquarters (RHQ): These offices are not allowed to earn income from Philippine sources and are exempt from income tax.

Partnership / LLP
The tax treatment of partnerships depends on their nature.

General Professional Partnership (GPP):

A partnership formed by professionals for the sole purpose of practicing their common profession.

The GPP itself is not a taxable entity for income tax purposes (it's a "pass-through" entity).

The individual partners are the ones liable for income tax on their share of the GPP's income.

Payments to partners are subject to a creditable withholding tax of 10% or 15% depending on the annual income threshold.

General Partnership (Non-GPP) / Limited Liability Partnership (LLP):

Treated as a corporation for tax purposes.

Subject to the same CIT rates, schedules, and other tax obligations as a domestic corporation.

Cooperative
Cooperatives are generally exempt from income tax on income from operations with members.

Income Tax Exemption: Cooperatives with a Certificate of Tax Exemption (CTE) are exempt from income tax on transactions with their members.

Taxable Income: Income from non-member transactions or from unrelated activities is taxable and subject to standard corporate income tax rates.

Filing Requirements: Even if exempt, cooperatives are required to file tax returns and other reports with the BIR and the Cooperative Development Authority (CDA).

NGO / Non-Profit
Non-stock, non-profit corporations are generally exempt from income tax on income from their activities related to their purpose (religious, charitable, etc.).

Taxable Income: Any income derived from for-profit activities or from their properties (e.g., rentals) is subject to income tax.

Filing Requirements: Like cooperatives, they must still file tax returns to report their income, even if it is non-taxable, to maintain their tax-exempt status.

Government Entity / GOCC
Income Tax: Government entities and instrumentalities are generally exempt from income tax on income from essential government functions. However, Government-Owned and Controlled Corporations (GOCCs) and local government units (LGUs) are taxable on income from their proprietary (for-profit) functions.

Withholding Tax: The national government and its instrumentalities are generally exempt from withholding tax when they are the payee.

Importer / Exporter
These businesses face unique tax obligations at the border, in addition to their regular corporate or individual taxes.

Value-Added Tax (VAT):

Importers: Imports are subject to 12% VAT based on the total landed cost.

Exporters: Exports are generally zero-rated for VAT, meaning they can claim a refund or tax credit for the VAT they paid on their inputs.

Customs Duties and Excise Taxes: Importers must pay customs duties and any applicable excise taxes (e.g., on petroleum, tobacco, or alcohol) to the Bureau of Customs (BOC) before goods can be released.

Filing: VAT is filed quarterly, but importers and exporters must ensure proper documentation and declarations for all their transactions with the BOC.

Real Estate Developer
Real estate developers have specific tax obligations related to their property sales.

Corporate Income Tax: Subject to the same CIT rates and schedules as other corporations.

Value-Added Tax (VAT): The sale of residential and commercial properties is subject to 12% VAT if the selling price exceeds certain thresholds.

Expanded Withholding Tax (EWT): Buyers of real property from a developer are required to withhold a percentage of the purchase price (typically 1.5% to 6% depending on the property type and value) and remit it to the BIR.

Documentary Stamp Tax (DST): The sale of real property is subject to DST, which is paid by the seller.

Local Business Tax (LBT): Developers also pay LBT based on their gross receipts from real estate development and sales to the local government unit.
