## Step 1: OrganizationRegistration Table Implementation - COMPLETED ✅

### Summary
Successfully implemented the OrganizationRegistration table as specified in the TDD requirements. All tests are passing and coverage remains above 85%.

### Changes Made

#### Database Schema Updates
- **prisma/schema.prisma**: Added OrganizationRegistration model with all required fields:
  - Personal information: first_name, middle_name, last_name, trade_name
  - Business details: line_of_business, address_line, region, city, zip_code
  - Tax information: tin, rdo_code, contact_number, email_address, tax_type
  - Dates: start_date, reg_date
  - Audit: update_by field
  - Foreign key relationship to Organization table

#### DTO Updates
- **src/modules/organizations/dto/create-organization.dto.ts**: Extended with all OrganizationRegistration fields including proper validation decorators (@IsNotEmpty, @IsEmail, @Length, etc.)

#### Repository Layer
- **src/modules/organizations/repositories/organization.repository.ts**: Updated create method to include nested registration creation with user tracking

#### Service Layer
- **src/modules/organizations/services/organization.service.ts**: Modified to accept userId parameter for audit tracking

#### Controller Layer
- **src/modules/organizations/controllers/organization.controller.ts**: Updated to extract userId from JWT token and pass to service

#### Test Updates
- **src/modules/organizations/tests/step1.organization-repo.spec.ts**: Updated to test registration data creation
- **src/modules/organizations/tests/step7.2.organization-integration.spec.ts**: Updated integration tests
- **test/integration.e2e-spec.ts**: Updated e2e test payload to include all registration fields with proper ISO date formats

### Test Results
- **Unit Tests**: 148/148 passing ✅
- **E2E Tests**: 27/27 passing ✅
- **Coverage**: 85.95% (above 85% requirement) ✅
- **Build**: Successful ✅

### Database Migration
- Generated and applied Prisma migration for OrganizationRegistration table
- Client regenerated successfully

### Verification
- All CRUD operations for organizations now include registration data
- JWT authentication properly extracts user ID for audit trails
- Data validation works correctly for all registration fields
- End-to-end flow from API request to database storage confirmed working

### Next Steps
Ready to proceed to Step 2: Verify TaxClassification enum includes EXCEMPT value.

### Notes
- Fixed date format issues in e2e tests (start_date and reg_date now use ISO format)
- All existing functionality preserved
- No breaking changes to existing API contracts

## Step 2: TaxClassification EXCEMPT Enum Verification - COMPLETED ✅

### Summary
Verified that the TaxClassification enum already includes the EXCEMPT value and added comprehensive test coverage for it.

### Changes Made

#### Schema Verification
- **prisma/schema.prisma**: Confirmed TaxClassification enum includes EXCEMPT value
- Enum values: VAT, NON_VAT, EXCEMPT

#### Test Coverage Addition
- **src/modules/organizations/tests/step7.2.organization-integration.spec.ts**:
  - Added test case for creating organization with EXCEMPT tax classification
  - Added test case for filtering organizations by EXCEMPT tax classification
- Regenerated Prisma client to ensure TypeScript types include EXCEMPT

### Test Results
- **Unit Tests**: 150/150 passing ✅ (added 2 new tests)
- **E2E Tests**: 27/27 passing ✅
- **Coverage**: 85.95% (above 85% requirement) ✅
- **Build**: Successful ✅

### Verification
- EXCEMPT enum value is properly defined in schema
- TypeScript types correctly include EXCEMPT
- Organization creation and filtering work with EXCEMPT classification
- All existing functionality preserved

### Notes
- The EXCEMPT enum value was already present in the schema
- Added comprehensive test coverage to ensure EXCEMPT works in all scenarios
- No database migration needed as enum was already updated

### Next Steps
Ready to proceed to Step 3: Create new GET and UPDATE endpoints for OrganizationStatus and OrganizationRegistration.</content>
