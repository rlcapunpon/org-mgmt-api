## Step 1: OrganizationRegistration Table Implementation - COMPLETED ✅

### Summary
Successfully implemented the OrganizationRegistration table as specified in the TDD requirements. All tests are passing and coverage remains above 85%.

### Changes Made

#### Database Schema Updates
- **prisma/schema.prisma**: Added OrganizationRegistration model with all required fields:
  - Personal information: first_name, middle_name, last_name, trade_name
  - Business details: line_of_business, address_line, region, city, zip_code
  - Tax information: tin, rdo_code, contact_number, email_address, tax_type
  - Dates: start_date, reg_date
  - Audit: update_by field
  - Foreign key relationship to Organization table

#### DTO Updates
- **src/modules/organizations/dto/create-organization.dto.ts**: Extended with all OrganizationRegistration fields including proper validation decorators (@IsNotEmpty, @IsEmail, @Length, etc.)

#### Repository Layer
- **src/modules/organizations/repositories/organization.repository.ts**: Updated create method to include nested registration creation with user tracking

#### Service Layer
- **src/modules/organizations/services/organization.service.ts**: Modified to accept userId parameter for audit tracking

#### Controller Layer
- **src/modules/organizations/controllers/organization.controller.ts**: Updated to extract userId from JWT token and pass to service

#### Test Updates
- **src/modules/organizations/tests/step1.organization-repo.spec.ts**: Updated to test registration data creation
- **src/modules/organizations/tests/step7.2.organization-integration.spec.ts**: Updated integration tests
- **test/integration.e2e-spec.ts**: Updated e2e test payload to include all registration fields with proper ISO date formats

### Test Results
- **Unit Tests**: 148/148 passing ✅
- **E2E Tests**: 27/27 passing ✅
- **Coverage**: 85.95% (above 85% requirement) ✅
- **Build**: Successful ✅

### Database Migration
- Generated and applied Prisma migration for OrganizationRegistration table
- Client regenerated successfully

### Verification
- All CRUD operations for organizations now include registration data
- JWT authentication properly extracts user ID for audit trails
- Data validation works correctly for all registration fields
- End-to-end flow from API request to database storage confirmed working

### Next Steps
Ready to proceed to Step 2: Verify TaxClassification enum includes EXCEMPT value.

### Notes
- Fixed date format issues in e2e tests (start_date and reg_date now use ISO format)
- All existing functionality preserved
- No breaking changes to existing API contracts

---

## Step 2: TaxClassification EXCEMPT Enum Verification - COMPLETED ✅

### Summary
Verified that the TaxClassification enum already includes the EXCEMPT value and added comprehensive test coverage for it.

### Changes Made

#### Schema Verification
- **prisma/schema.prisma**: Confirmed TaxClassification enum includes EXCEMPT value
- Enum values: VAT, NON_VAT, EXCEMPT

#### Test Coverage Addition
- **src/modules/organizations/tests/step7.2.organization-integration.spec.ts**:
  - Added test case for creating organization with EXCEMPT tax classification
  - Added test case for filtering organizations by EXCEMPT tax classification
- Regenerated Prisma client to ensure TypeScript types include EXCEMPT

### Test Results
- **Unit Tests**: 150/150 passing ✅ (added 2 new tests)
- **E2E Tests**: 27/27 passing ✅
- **Coverage**: 85.95% (above 85% requirement) ✅
- **Build**: Successful ✅

### Verification
- EXCEMPT enum value is properly defined in schema
- TypeScript types correctly include EXCEMPT
- Organization creation and filtering work with EXCEMPT classification
- All existing functionality preserved

### Notes
- The EXCEMPT enum value was already present in the schema
- Added comprehensive test coverage to ensure EXCEMPT works in all scenarios
- No database migration needed as enum was already updated

### Next Steps
Ready to proceed to Step 3: Create new GET and UPDATE endpoints for OrganizationStatus and OrganizationRegistration.

---

## Step 3: OrganizationStatus and OrganizationRegistration Endpoints - COMPLETED ✅

### Summary
Successfully implemented GET and UPDATE endpoints for OrganizationStatus and OrganizationRegistration tables following TDD methodology. All tests are passing with comprehensive coverage.

### Changes Made

#### DTOs
- **src/modules/organizations/dto/update-organization-status-registration.dto.ts**:
  - Created UpdateOrganizationStatusDto with status validation (@IsIn with valid status values)
  - Created UpdateOrganizationRegistrationDto with optional fields and email validation (@IsEmail)
  - Added proper class-validator decorators for data validation

#### Repository Layer
- **src/modules/organizations/repositories/organization.repository.ts**:
  - Added getStatusByOrgId() method for retrieving organization status
  - Added updateStatus() method for updating organization status
  - Added getRegistrationByOrgId() method for retrieving organization registration
  - Added updateRegistration() method for updating organization registration

#### Service Layer
- **src/modules/organizations/services/organization.service.ts**:
  - Added getStatusByOrgId() method with error handling (P2025 → NotFoundException)
  - Added updateStatus() method with error handling
  - Added getRegistrationByOrgId() method with error handling
  - Added updateRegistration() method with error handling

#### Controller Layer
- **src/modules/organizations/controllers/organization.controller.ts**:
  - Added GET /organizations/:id/status endpoint
  - Added PUT /organizations/:id/status endpoint
  - Added PATCH /organizations/:id/status endpoint
  - Added GET /organizations/:id/registration endpoint
  - Added PUT /organizations/:id/registration endpoint
  - Added PATCH /organizations/:id/registration endpoint
  - All endpoints include proper Swagger documentation and permission guards

#### Test Implementation
- **src/modules/organizations/tests/step3.organization-status-registration.spec.ts**:
  - Created comprehensive test suite with 12 test cases
  - Tests all GET/PUT/PATCH endpoints for both status and registration
  - Includes permission testing, validation testing, and error handling
  - Fixed permission strings to use 'resource:read' and 'resource:update'
  - Added ValidationPipe to test app setup for proper DTO validation
  - Mocked Prisma errors correctly with { code: 'P2025' } for 404 testing

#### E2E Test Implementation
- **test/integration.e2e-spec.ts**:
  - Added 6 new e2e test cases for the new endpoints
  - Tests GET/PUT/PATCH for both status and registration endpoints
  - Updated authRequest helper to support PATCH method
  - Tests verify proper response structure and data integrity
  - All e2e tests pass (33/33 total tests)

#### Test Infrastructure Updates
- **coding-context/test-files-inventory.md**: Added new test file to inventory (21 total test files)

### API Endpoints Added

#### Organization Status Endpoints
- `GET /organizations/:id/status` - Get organization status by organization ID
- `PUT /organizations/:id/status` - Update organization status (full update)
- `PATCH /organizations/:id/status` - Update organization status (partial update)

#### Organization Registration Endpoints
- `GET /organizations/:id/registration` - Get organization registration by organization ID
- `PUT /organizations/:id/registration` - Update organization registration (full update)
- `PATCH /organizations/:id/registration` - Update organization registration (partial update)

### Test Results
- **Unit Tests**: 166/166 passing ✅ (added 12 new tests)
- **E2E Tests**: 33/33 passing ✅ (added 6 new e2e tests for new endpoints)
- **Coverage**: Maintained above 85% requirement ✅
- **Build**: Successful ✅

### Security & Validation
- JWT authentication required for all endpoints
- RBAC permissions enforced ('resource:read' for GET, 'resource:update' for PUT/PATCH)
- Input validation using class-validator decorators
- Proper error handling with 404 for not found, 403 for unauthorized, 400 for validation errors

### Database Operations
- Regenerated Prisma client to include OrganizationRegistration model
- All operations use proper Prisma queries with error handling
- Foreign key relationships maintained

### Verification
- All endpoints return correct HTTP status codes
- Permission guards work correctly
- DTO validation rejects invalid data
- Error handling provides appropriate responses
- End-to-end flow from API to database confirmed working

### Notes
- Followed strict TDD: wrote failing tests first, then implemented code to make tests pass
- All endpoints support both PUT (full update) and PATCH (partial update)
- Validation includes enum checking for status and email format validation
- Comprehensive test coverage includes happy path, error cases, and permission scenarios

### Next Steps
Step 3 complete. Ready to proceed to next step or refinements.</content>
