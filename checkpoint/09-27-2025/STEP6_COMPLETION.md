# STEP 09-27-2025.STEP6 - User Overview Endpoint - COMPLETED ✅

## Summary
Successfully implemented the user overview endpoint that provides a dashboard view of:
- Number of organizations owned by the user
- Number of organizations assigned to the user (via RBAC permissions)
- Number of obligations due within 30 days
- Total number of obligations in the system

## Technical Implementation

### Architecture
- **NestJS Module**: Complete users module with service, controller, and repository layers
- **RBAC Integration**: HTTP client calls to RBAC API for permission-based organization access
- **Database Queries**: Extended existing repositories with new methods for user-specific data
- **Authentication**: JWT-based with permission guards

### Key Components

#### UserService.getUserOverview()
- Aggregates data from multiple sources
- Handles RBAC API integration with error resilience
- Supports super admin users with "*" permissions
- Returns structured overview data

#### API Endpoint: GET /users/overview
- Requires `user.read` permission
- Returns JSON response with dashboard metrics
- Fully documented in OpenAPI specification

#### Repository Extensions
- `OrganizationOwnerRepository.getOwnersByUserId()`: Find organizations owned by user
- `OrganizationObligationRepository.countObligationsDueWithinDays()`: Count due obligations
- `OrganizationObligationRepository.countTotalObligations()`: Total obligation count

### Testing & Quality
- **TDD Approach**: Created failing tests before implementation
- **Unit Tests**: 4 comprehensive test cases covering all scenarios
- **E2E Tests**: Authentication and authorization validation
- **Coverage**: 86.97% (exceeds 85% requirement)
- **All Tests Passing**: 344/344 tests successful

### Security & Reliability
- JWT authentication with user ID extraction
- Permission-based access control
- Graceful RBAC API failure handling
- Input validation and error handling
