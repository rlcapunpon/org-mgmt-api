## Summary
Successfully aligned PUT /organizations/{id} endpoint with POST /organizations endpoint to support comprehensive organization updates.

## Key Changes Implemented
- **UpdateOrganizationRequestDto**: Expanded to include all fields from CreateOrganizationRequestDto (registration and operation data)
- **OrganizationService.update()**: Enhanced to handle comprehensive updates including nested organization registration and operation data
- **OrganizationRepository**: Updated updateRegistration() and updateOperation() methods to use check-then-create-or-update logic for related entities
- **OpenAPI Specification**: Updated checkpoint/org-mgmt-api.yaml to remove outdated 'name' field from CreateOrganizationRequestDto schema
- **Tests**: Added comprehensive PUT endpoint test covering all supported fields

## Validation Results
- ✅ All unit tests pass (363/363)
- ✅ All e2e tests pass (44/44)
- ✅ OpenAPI spec synchronized with implementation
- ✅ Build successful

## Technical Details
- Organization names are computed from category-specific fields (first_name/middle_name/last_name for INDIVIDUAL, registered_name for NON_INDIVIDUAL)
- Repository methods implement create-or-update logic for organization registration and operation records
- DTO validation uses conditional @ValidateIf decorators based on organization category
- PUT endpoint now supports full organization lifecycle management

## Next Steps
Ready to proceed to subsequent development steps.
