# STEP2 COMPLETION - RBAC API Integration
Date: 2025-09-28
Status: COMPLETED

## Summary
Successfully integrated RBAC API calls into organization creation workflow. The org-mgmt-api now calls the RBAC API's POST /api/resources endpoint whenever a new organization is successfully created.

## Changes Made
1. **Module Configuration**: Added HttpModule to OrganizationsModule imports
2. **Service Layer**: Modified OrganizationService.create() to make HTTP POST to RBAC API after successful database creation
3. **Controller Layer**: Updated OrganizationController.create() to extract JWT token from request headers and pass to service
4. **Unit Tests**: Created comprehensive unit tests for RBAC integration scenarios
5. **E2E Tests**: Added nock mocking for RBAC API calls in integration tests

## Key Features
- JWT token extraction from Authorization header
- Graceful error handling (RBAC failures don't prevent org creation)
- Proper HTTP headers (Content-Type, Authorization)
- Comprehensive test coverage for success and failure scenarios

## Test Results
- Unit tests: PASS (3/3 tests)
- E2E tests: PASS (44/44 tests)
- Build: OK
- Linting: OK

## Notes
The implementation follows TDD principles with failing tests written first, then implementation to make them pass. RBAC API integration is non-blocking - organization creation succeeds even if RBAC API is unavailable.
